# API Policies
These are machine-readable API policies that define and connect the business rationale that exists behind how we govern APIs, providing a business bridge between Spectral rules governing the technical details, and the research, discussion, guidance, and experience that inform why we are governing our API operations.

All of the [policies applied to APIs.io APIs use the API Commons policy schema are available in a single YAML file](policies.yml) in this repository. These policies are rapidly evolving to support development right now and changes often, providing a way to filter, organize, and apply different areas of API governance in different ways--bridging the business and technical details of API governance.

## API Commons
API policies are a new [API Commons](https://apicommons.org) schema that provide a way to define the business details of API governance in a machine-readable, which can be then used in dashboards, reporting, and other visuals intended for business stakeholders, helping bring more visibility and participation across the API lifecycle.

# API Policies, Rules, Experience, and Guidance
Policies are the bridge between rules and the policies, experience, and guidance, but rules can (and are) be used all by themselves. My approach to API governance focuses on the reality that we are primarily investing in the technical details of API governance, and that we are neglecting the business details required.

This work acknowledges that services, tooling, and the general approach of API governance is only using rules applied to OpenAPI, which is beginning to expand to AsyncAPI, GraphQL, and Arazzo workflows, but is proposing the first schema for aligning this work with business objectives, when teams are ready for it.

## Support
This work is in early stage of development and rapidly moving as they are being applied in a variety of user interfaces and approaches to the automation and reporting of API governance. If you would like to contribute, have any questions, or would like to inform the work happening, please submit a GitHub issue on the repository or email kin@apievangelist.com.
